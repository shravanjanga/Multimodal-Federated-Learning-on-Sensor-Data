**Motivation:**
Federated Learning (FL) ensures privacy while training machine learning models. Multimodal sensor data, combining various sensing modalities, demands FL for 
privacy-preserving collaboration. This project aims to understand and extend multimodal FL.
  
**Design Goals:**
- Benchmarking: Replicate paper results using provided datasets.
- Accuracy Analysis: Evaluate per-class accuracy and address skewed data.
- Data Distribution: Study the impact of imbalanced data

**Deliverables:**
- Reproduced experimental results.
- Per-class accuracy analysis.
- Insights into data distribution's effect.
- Evaluation on balanced datasets.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**
-Python Environment.
-Laptop with CUDA-enabled GPU (optional).

**Team Members:** Shravan Janga
